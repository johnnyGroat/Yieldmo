# Java Portion
Classes implement the code to complete each challenge and are located within the src directory.  Each program has a series of tests that run what was perceived as the correct input/output as outlined in the challenge instructions.  It should be as straight forward as running the java tests (which pass) to ensure each program works properly.

# SQL
SQL Scripts are in the SQL directory.  All contained in one file, and build using MySQL (in case there are any syntax discrepancies with other DBMS).
